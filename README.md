Project Easy
====

# Overview
This project is a suggestion for developers on how to use Symfony2 bundles in a way that provides maximum 
flexibility, extensibility and maintainability. 
Apart from sample code there is a documentation explaining this concept.

# Why?
Not every team, developer has enough experience to structure things correctly from the beginning. Sometimes it is very useful to prepare certain things so that later would be safe.

Real life example could be the following one. You do create integration with one payment gateway, but after you go live, they do shut you down for some reason and you have to switch to your backup provider, until main one will be sorted. 

If you will base your application on first integration you will experience hard times switching to the new provider. But if you will spent a little more time on putting few structures in place you will be smiling once that day will come.  

I do not want to say that what this is the right way, all I am saying is that this project is just a suggestion, that was practically successfully adopted. And because it is really simple and easy to use I believe some people would make use of it.

Project Easy
====

# Overview
This project is a suggestion for developers on how to use Symfony2 bundles in a way that provides maximum 
flexibility, extensibility and maintainability. 
Apart from sample code there is a documentation explaining this concept.

# Why?
Not every team, developer has enough experience to structure things correctly from the beginning. Sometimes it is very useful to prepare certain things so that later would be safe.

Real life example could be the following one. You do create integration with one payment gateway, but after you go live, they do shut you down for some reason and you have to switch to your backup provider, until main one will be sorted.

Project Easy

Overview
====
This project template is a suggestion for developers how to use Symfony2 bundles in a way that provides maximum 
flexibility, extensibility and maintainability. 
Apart from sample code there is a documentation explaining this concept.

Why?
====
You shouldn't be spending to much time on thinking about how big you will grow and what you will do when your
system will get big enough. But it is usefull to know that once you will hit that you still will be able to proceed
with development and fulfill business requirements. So this project is all about showing a way how this could be achieved
by using Sf2 bundles.
Symfony2 bundles are very powefull and nice concept that I admire. But by extending this concept a little, 
we can gain even more benefit. 
As you will see I do not introduce any complex things, it's all about applying few patterns and adding few rules. 
It's simple and that is exactly what I want to achieve - easy but beneficial usage.
